# WeAct-STM32H7-Tutorials

This project provides clear and practical examples of how to work with the WeAct STM32H7 development board. It explains how to configure the MCU, display, camera, and other modules step by step.
It is intended for beginners and hobbyists who want an easy and straightforward guide to using this board and learning embedded development on STM32H7.


## Getting Started

After you receive your WeAct STM32H7 board, the first thing you will probably want
to do is get the display working.  
To begin, you need to install the official STM32 development environment —
**STM32CubeIDE**, available from the STMicroelectronics website.  
This tool will allow you to configure the MCU, generate initialization code,
compile the project, and flash the firmware to your board.
